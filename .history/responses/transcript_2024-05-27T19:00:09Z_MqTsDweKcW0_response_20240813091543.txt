Title: Approaching a Difficult Conversation 

Your words have power!

That power includes speaking over a difficult conversation. Speak kindness, love, and patience into it, not just the topic. Behave thoughtfully, and consider how your words are received.

For example, before we proceed, I want to let you know that I'm coming into this conversation with an open mind, Ed. I want you to give me everything that's on your mind, and I hope that you'll be patient with me throughout. 

At the end of this, I truly hope we can walk away having found ways to be kinder to each other. Let's see how we can frame the conversation by speaking over it. Visualize a picture where we put that into practice, Envision how that might look.
