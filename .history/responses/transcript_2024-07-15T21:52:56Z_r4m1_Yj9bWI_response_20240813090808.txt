Title: Conversation with Jefferson Fischer

"My name is Jefferson Fischer. I'm a board-certified Texas trial attorney and owner of Fischer firm. You may have seen some of my videos out there on social media about how to communicate, but all of those videos are less than a minute. Now, I've been getting more and more requests to dive deeper into the communication lessons that I teach.

That's what I'm going to do and what's going to be different about what we're doing here compared to other shows is that they're going to be short 15-20 minute episodes. Maybe they'll be longer in the future, maybe not, but right now, I'm just going to meet you where I am.

I'm a practicing trial attorney so I'm going to make sure that what I give you is short, impactful, and practical in your next conversation. What you're going to find over time is that your conversations will be easier, and you can even change your life just one conversation at a time. Welcome to the Jefferson Fischer podcast."
