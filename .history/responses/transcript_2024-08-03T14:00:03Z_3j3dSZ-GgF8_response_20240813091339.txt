Title: How to Stand Up for Yourself

Jefferson Fischer: "Here's how to stand up for yourself. My name is Jefferson Fischer. I'm a trial attorney and I teach people how to argue and communicate. The first thing to know about standing up for yourself is knowing when to do it because not everybody's worth getting out of your chair for. It is essential to know your worth. A mentality about every little thing that somebody says does not mean it requires a response from you. So, just because they spew out trash does not mean we're in the business of digging through the garbage.

Eliminate apologies and conditional language before making your position known. Own your boundaries. Get in the habit of saying no without justifying it. If you start justifying and telling your position well, now they're going to start defending against your justification. Have the habit of coming up with a better solution rather than justifying your stance. Try that and follow me."
