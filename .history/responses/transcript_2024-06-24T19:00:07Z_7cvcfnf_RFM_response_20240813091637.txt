**Title: Tips on Communication and Interruptions**

In the video, the speaker emphasized the importance of knowing what to say and how to communicate effectively when someone won't stop talking. 

One strategy suggested is to use the person's name and address the issue directly. For example, saying, "Jefferson, what you're doing is getting their attention."

Another point made is about interrupting in a courteous manner. It was mentioned that acknowledging the interruption can prevent the act from feeling rude or dismissive.

When it comes to acknowledging interruptions, it is crucial to convey that you are aware of the interruption without making the other person feel cut off. By acknowledging their right to speak, the conversation can flow more smoothly.

The video also touched on the effectiveness of keeping interruptions brief. For instance, saying, "I've got to go" while respecting the conversation.

Further suggestions included turning off the "word faucet" by letting someone finish speaking before offering input for a more productive discussion.

In conclusion, effective communication involves not only knowing what to say but also how to listen and respond appropriately in conversations to ensure mutual understanding and respect.
