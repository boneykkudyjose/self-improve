Title: Tips on How to Be More Open-Minded

Now, I don't know if anybody's told you this, but you can listen to another person's opinion without having to share your own. Just because theirs is different doesn't mean you have to disagree. My nose looks different than your nose, my heart beats different than your heart, so why wouldn't my brain think different than your brain? The key to being more open-minded is to be curious, to think of their opinions as them painting a picture. Learn to appreciate it by asking questions like where did you learn that or how long did it take you to find this out yourself?

Don't assume you know the full picture when they're just getting started. That's how you get to be more open-minded so try that and follow me.
