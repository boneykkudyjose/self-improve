Title: How to Respond When Someone is Rude to You

When someone is rude, it's important to consider your response carefully. Number one, start your response with "Did you mean for that to be insulting?" Number two, if it's somebody who's passive-aggressive, I will typically use statements that sound like I'm asking, "What's affecting your mood?" 

This approach allows them a less direct method of explaining what's bothering them. Ignoring rude comments can also be powerful. If they say something rude to you, just give it silence. Give it one or two moments, then move on. This is how to handle somebody who's being rude to you effectively. So, try these strategies and see how they work for you.
