Title: Tips on Assertive Communication

In this video, tips are shared on how to sound more assertive when speaking to others. Instead of saying, "You can't," try saying, "Number one." Speak to me in a way that you will say, "I do." Do not respond to what you're saying with, "Number two" instead of saying "You're interrupting me; you'll say." 

Another tip provided is to establish a standard and threshold of respect that others must meet before receiving a response. Your words are worth my response; you must respect that. I have a standard, a threshold of respect that you must meet before your words are acknowledged. 

When communicating, make your point clear without wasting time. For example, instead of saying, "You're going to wait your turn," try saying, "People who are committed to misunderstanding you." Be direct and confident in your communication. Say what needs to be said assertively, and follow through with clarity and confidence.
