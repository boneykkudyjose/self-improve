Title: How to Respond to Someone Who Complains

One might wonder, "What to say to someone who complains to you?" Well, you are number one; make them keep going when somebody is complaining to you, it's typically a sign of a much bigger problem, meaning it'll spread to other issues or even other people. You want them to get it all out; that means that instead of criticizing the complainer, you're going to create a path for them.

For number two, you're going to empower them with solutions once they have gotten it all out; you can try any of these phrases: When somebody complains to you, you are going to respond with, "Okay, tell me more," and you keep doing that. That as often times as you need. When they're going to keep complaining all right, tell me more, and you keep doing that. That's one of the ways to address it, and you follow me.
