**How to Stand Up for Yourself - Part Two**

If it's worth standing up for yourself, stand up for you better.

Learn to stand still, "we're going to do that by one drawing a line over how they are allowed to speak to us," I said aloud.

Because you are the bouncer to your own self-esteem, we draw that boundary by explaining it like it's a new card game.

These are the rules, these are the parameters under which I operate, and if you can't follow those, if you can't speak to me respectfully, then you will not get what you want from me.

Once you set that boundary, you cannot take one single step back whenever an emotional response comes out of their mouth.

"Only if you feel comfortable, that is going to be productive, if not, just give it time, a phrase that has helped me is if it's worth talking about."

"Now, it's worth talking about later, and that's how you stand up for yourself, so try that, don't follow me."
