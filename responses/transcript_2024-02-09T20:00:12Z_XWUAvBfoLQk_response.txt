Title: How to Detect When You've Been Talking Too Long

In the video transcript, the speaker discusses various signs that indicate when one has been talking excessively. 

The speaker mentions that if you find yourself repeating and circling back to the same point, it may be a clue that you're talking too much. This repetitive behavior is likened to repackaging the same information repeatedly. 

Additionally, the speaker highlights that if the listener appears disinterested or disengaged, it's a signal to wrap up the conversation. 

Moreover, forgetting the initial topic or question posed can also indicate that the conversation has gone on for too long. 

The speaker advises that if someone is still engaged after you've paused, they may have a question or comment, but if they don't, it could be a sign that the conversation has dragged on. 

Therefore, it's essential to be attentive to non-verbal cues and responses during a conversation to ensure that it remains engaging and informative.
