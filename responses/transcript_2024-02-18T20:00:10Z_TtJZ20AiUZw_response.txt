Title: How to Not Be Dismissive in an Argument

In an argument, it's easy to just take ownership of your own words and actions instead.

Rather than pushing it off on the other person, for example, if you say, "I'm sorry," you should feel that way to somebody. It's not dismissive in an apology at all, it's very important.

Taking ownership of your own words and actions is crucial. Try something like, "I'm sorry that my behavior or conduct made you feel that way."

Or just try saying, "I'm sorry, period."

But at least take ownership for what you're doing, so try that and follow me.
