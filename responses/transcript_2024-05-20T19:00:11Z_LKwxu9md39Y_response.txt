Title: Demanding an Apology

"I want is an apology! Demanding an apology is a lose-lose situation because you had to ask, so it's not going to feel genuine.

You are getting an apology now because you asked instead of starting with 'can we talk about what happened?' Then provide an opportunity for an apology.

Because the only reason you're getting it is that you had to ask, it's not going to be genuine.

It's a transactional situation; this for that. And if you make the other person apologize, they're going to feel better, but you're going to feel just the same.

Opportunity for a genuine apology. You're never going to be satisfied with one that you sold yourself, so try that and follow me."
