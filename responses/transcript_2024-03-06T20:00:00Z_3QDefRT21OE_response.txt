Title: How to Know When to Say Something and When to Let It Go!

How do you know when to say something or when to let it go? It can be tricky to navigate those situations.

Let It Go number one when the feelings won't fade. Say something, yeah maybe your mind has let it go, but your true feelings won't dissipate. They'll continue to carry it around without you even realizing.

If the feelings won't fade, you need to say something. If you're only going to make the relationship better, is it only to make me feel better and if it's only for you, you should probably let it go.

Let it go, and if they are worth your time, say something. If this person is worth your attention, then you need to make the effort.

To say something or else you lose out on the opportunity to strengthen that relationship because unsaid words don't make strong bonds. So try that and follow me.
