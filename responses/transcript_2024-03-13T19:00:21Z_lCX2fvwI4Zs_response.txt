Title: How to Shut Down a Toxic Conversation

In this video, the speaker discusses strategies for handling toxic conversations effectively. 

Number one, use the phrase "right here" if you're arguing and it's becoming toxic. 

When things get louder and messier, you can put a stop to it and grab their attention with the phrase "right here." 

If you're interested in resolving the situation, consider the phrase "right here, what you're saying is." 

Is this the moment that you need to step back and reevaluate? 

If you find yourself in a toxic conversation, are you interested in changing the course? 

Are you willing to engage in a new dialogue to find a solution? 

Consider if this relationship is worth your time. 

Evaluate if there's potential for improvement or if it's time to move on. 

Reflect on what you're doing and the impact it's having on the conversation. 

Express your boundaries and willingness to shift the conversation. 

If the other party agrees, you can transition to a new topic smoothly. 

Open up about where you stand and encourage them to do the same. 

Discuss a solution that works for both parties if possible. 

If not, accept their response and move forward accordingly. 

Ultimately, knowing how to handle a toxic conversation can help you navigate difficult interactions successfully.
