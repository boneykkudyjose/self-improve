Title: How to Control Your Conversation Number

"How to control your conversation number." 

One must set the direction. This can sound like, "I'd like to speak with you about."

Your comments at yesterday's meeting or,

"I need to talk with you about our plans." 

For tomorrow afternoon, you're setting, 

"the true north of the conversation."

Number two, call your shot, meaning the very next thing you're going to say is,

"How you want the conversation to end for example, I'd like to talk with you about what you said yesterday and I want to walk away with us having better communication."

Number three, get their commitment, meaning, 

"in the frame with something like, does that sound good to you? Or, can we agree to that?"

"So, let's put it all together. For example, I'd like to talk with you about what you said yesterday and I'd like to walk away with us having a better relationship. Does that sound okay to you?" 

"And when you put it that way, they'll rarely ever say no, and that's how to better control your conversation. So, try that and follow me."
