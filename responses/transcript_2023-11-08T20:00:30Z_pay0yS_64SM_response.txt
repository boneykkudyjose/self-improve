**How to Stop Over-Apologizing**

What I'm talking about so sorry, I just need to clarify something real quick. Sorry, I'm just now seeing this so sorry!

I need to clarify I'm sorry I just need to clarify something real quick so. Sorry, sorry.

I'm just now responding when you over-apologize you are draining your power.

Because what you're really saying in those little, so sorry, moments is please. Still like me and it is past time that you knew that your self-worth is not tied.

To how little of an inconvenience you can be so here's a little trick when somebody needs something from you you.

Thank them thank them for waiting thank them.

For their patience thank their time when you need something from them.

Tell them what you want without apologizing you tell them what.

You need so instead of I'm sorry to bother you I need a moment of your time when you get a second instead of hey I'm.

Sorry I need to clarify I need to add on to what you just said you are asserting.

Your needs and that never needs an apology so try that and follow me.
