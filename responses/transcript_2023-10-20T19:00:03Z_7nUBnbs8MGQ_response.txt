**Handling People Who Waste Your Time**

One key tip is to stop saying yes to vague requests. Instead, set clear boundaries. For example, when someone asks for a meeting, you can respond assertively by asking for more details.

Another strategy is to limit the time you allocate to others. If someone asks for a few minutes of your time, politely decline if you are unable to accommodate them. Remember, your time is precious.

Moreover, avoid doing other people's work for them. Encourage self-sufficiency by guiding them on finding solutions themselves. This will empower them and lighten your load.

Setting boundaries and asserting yourself when necessary is essential. If someone is taking up too much of your time, it's okay to interrupt and redirect the conversation. Respect your time and make it clear how you want to be approached.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more efficient and respectful dynamic in your interactions, ensuring that your time is valued and used effectively.
