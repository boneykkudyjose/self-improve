Title: Responding Effectively to Comments

In the video transcript, a question is raised: "What to say when someone says you look tired." The response given is to say, "Number one respond with 'and that's supposed to make me feel better, it's a question they can't answer yes or no without admitting what they said was pretty rude'." 

Another situation presented is when someone suggests a particular action, the appropriate response is to say, "No without admitting that what they said was pretty rude, it was most likely you're going to get them to withdraw the statement." 

In a different scenario, if someone makes a statement that appears offensive, one can respond with, "Was pretty rude, most likely you're going to get them to withdraw the statement."

To handle the situation where someone expresses discontent with a particular idea, it is advised to reply with, "So coffee is on you then, right?"

In conclusion, knowing how to respond when faced with various comments or criticisms is key in effectively managing social interactions. Each reply should be tailored to the specific situation to ensure clear communication and understanding between individuals.
