Title: How to Stop a Heated Argument

One effective way to stop a heated argument is to take a step back and ask the question, "Is this something we have to agree on?"

The answer you will likely hear is no, and when you do it automatically brings down the heat because instead of focusing on convincing the other person, you're now focused on understanding them.

This shift in focus diffuses an argument altogether because it suggests that there is at least a possibility that their way could be the right way, and often that's all they need to hear.

Sometimes, it's not about what you say, but how you say it. So when somebody starts to raise their voice, resist the temptation to match it.

Instead, lower your voice and slow down your words when you do, they will mirror yours and bring it down. 

This is how to stop a heated argument, so try that and follow me.
