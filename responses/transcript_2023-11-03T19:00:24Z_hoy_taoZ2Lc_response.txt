Rules for Arguing with a Narcissist

Three rules for arguing with a narcissist! Rule number one: the most powerful move you can make is no move at all. A narcissist is hoping that you say something ugly because once you do, the whole construct of the conversation changes. They flip the script, so it's now all about what you just did, which means less attention to what they've been doing. 

When you have those chances to hurt them, don't fall into the trap! Rule number two: you don't need an apology to validate your feelings. Don't get caught up in trying to show or make them understand how they hurt you. A narcissist knows full well what they're doing, so they know they're hurting you. They may not know why they're doing it, but they know what hurts. 

However, walking away may be the healthiest response you can make instead of trying to fix the situation. From a narcissist's perspective, maybe the issue that needs correction is not theirs but yours. Take care of your peace of mind and follow what brings you peace.
