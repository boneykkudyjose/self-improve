**How to Stop Oversharing**

Oversharing if you wouldn't share your personal closet with them, don't share your personal thoughts with them when you overshare it's like handing out your favorite sweatshirt, the other person is not going to love it like you do.

Protected or guarded, like you do. So, help with that. Try this: number one, add a filter. They need to know it now. We want them to understand that.

When you overshare, you undervalue the price of your words. Even when you answer that harmless question at work, how was your weekend? It allows the other person to create a perception of you, for good or bad. That comes at a very high cost.

Understand that true connection rarely comes from just talking about yourself. So if you ever think I'm talking too much, the answer is always yes. So, try that and follow me.
