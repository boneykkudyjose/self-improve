Title: Analyzing Communication Strategies for Dealing with Stonewalling

When someone is stonewalling, what to do?

You number one, stop pulling if somebody has disengaged from a conversation let them be because if they wanted to be there, they would. They don't be tempted to say ugly things to provoke them just to get a reaction.

To respond back when they're stonewalling you, it's like playing tug-of-war with a tree. Stop pulling, let go of the rope, and take care of yourself.

Number two, be assertive. We're going to do that by using boundaries because this can't go on forever. You need a backbone, stop giving them your peace of mind. Let them know when you can expect to hear from them.

When they stonewall you, their silence says you're not worth the effort, and that's not somebody you want to be around. So, try that, follow me.
