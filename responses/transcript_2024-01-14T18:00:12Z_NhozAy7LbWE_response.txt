**Title: Dealing with Belittlement**

What to say when someone belittles you? Number one: make them say it again when you just said. That was meant to put you down. You take all the fun out of it when you calmly say, "I need you to repeat that, or I want you to say that again."

Spotlight on their behavior and that makes them nervous. Number two: regardless if they actually had the guts to repeat it. You say, "Did you want that to hurt me? Did you intend to embarrass me instead of apologizing?"

They're expecting a dopamine hit they were hoping for from your reaction. So, using questions of intent, these words sound like... Did you want that to hurt me?

Do they get nervous no matter what they say? Don't respond and let your silence speak volumes. Your answer will likely say more.

Now it's their turn to face themselves. The question now becomes, what was my purpose in saying that?

No matter what they say, don't respond. Let your silence be the one who has control. That's how you handle somebody who's trying to belittle you. Try to follow that and see how they react.
