Title: Stop an Argument Before It Escalates!

In a conversation, knowing when to stop an argument is crucial. When you keep restarting it, talking about the same thing over and over in a circle, what this typically sounds like is somebody will say, "I just can't understand," and they go back to the original point again. It's not that they can't understand; they're not ready to when that happens. You need to stop the argument and pick up the conversation another time.

Personal attacks can be hurtful. When someone starts calling you names, saying you're so stupid or worse, what they're really telling you is they're spent. They have nothing else left to contribute.

A personal attack is the lowest hanging fruit in an argument. It's essential to recognize that when you're emotionally drained, you might start to raise your voice more often or interrupt the other person. Feeling like you're out of control is a sign that it's time to stop, take a breather, and find out what path is best for you. Follow me.
