Title: How Lawyers Can Tell If You're Lying During Cross-Examination

When cross-examining somebody, one of the dead giveaways I get with a witness is typically their inflection. That's like the sing-song of their voice.

And, I kind of see a checkmark in my mind of it going down and then going up. So, like if you hear a "nuh-uh," I didn't do that!

That's pretty much a giveaway that it's, "I didn't do that," nuh-uh. And, uh, the inflection starts to rise another notch.

One is if they repeat the question back to me. So, if I say, "You didn't see the red car that day?" And they reply, "I didn't see the red car. It's pretty much a "Day Giveaway." 

They delay their response, so they can think of a better response than the truth. This is one kind of fun, the eyebrows. For me, it means eye contact.

That doesn't necessarily mean you're lying. It can mean all kinds of things like you just don't want to look at the person.
