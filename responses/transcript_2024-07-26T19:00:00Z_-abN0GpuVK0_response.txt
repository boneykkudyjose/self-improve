Title: How to Respond When Someone Talks Down to You

When someone talks down to you, it's essential to maintain your position. You are number one - flip the situation when somebody's talking down to you instead of staying in this inferior position. You will stay in control while they have no choice but to change their behavior.

Remember, whatever they tell you is either beneath you or below you. It's as easy as saying the way you're treating me right now is beneath me when you do that. When you flip that, the power dynamic shifts.

By using words that allow and give, for example, I will allow you to try that, you can hold your position.

If they treat you right now is beneath you, engage in the conversation for it to continue. If they speak to you differently, those are the terms of authority, and it sends the message that you are in complete control.

Consider how you will be treated, reset the conversation, and if you're willing, I'm willing to engage in this conversation.

Respectfully, I'm willing to talk with you if we're on the same page - it is you.

By lining out the instructions on how this conversation is to move forward. That's how to handle somebody who's talking down to you.
