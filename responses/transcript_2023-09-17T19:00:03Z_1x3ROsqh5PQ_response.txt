Title:How to sound more confident in your next meeting 
Here's a quick tip. The next time you're in a meeting and somebody asks for your opinion, instead of starting with "I think" or "I feel," which is very soft language, use more assertive language. Instead of saying "I predict" or "I anticipate," try something stronger like "I envision" or "I anticipate that."

For example, instead of saying "I feel like this is not going to work," replace that with "I anticipate that this isn't going to work." By using stronger language, it not only sounds more confident but also assumes that you have already thought about the answer.

Do that, and you're going to sound much more confident. So try that and follow me.
