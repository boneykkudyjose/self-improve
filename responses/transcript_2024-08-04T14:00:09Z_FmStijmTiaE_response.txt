Title: How to Respond to a Bully

"What to say to a bully? Number one, you're going to slowly ask the question: Are you okay? It signals to them that their behavior to the others around them is not okay and most importantly, it doesn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction!

From you, number two: Ask questions of intent. This sounds like, 'Did you mean to embarrass me? Did you mean for that to offend me? Did you want to upset me or hurt me with whatever it is you're giving them?'"

"Number three: Say this for attention or insecurity. They're going to ask, 'What do you mean you're going to respond? Did you say that for attention or insecurity and it'll make them think twice before saying something like that again, so try that."

"That and follow me."
