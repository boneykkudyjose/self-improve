Title: How to Become a Better Listener

If you want to be a better listener, try this. Most of the time when we're listening, we attach to the first thing that we want. To respond to then, all you think about is what you're going to say, rather than listening to what they're saying. That's not the best approach. Instead, listen to ask a question.

Question whether you ask a question or not, but that's why interviewers are so good at listening. Attorneys during depositions, they're not. Listening to make a point, they're not.

It's much better to listen to what they're saying. That's when they really say what they want to say. 

If you miss what they said, just ask them to repeat the last part. Most of the time, everybody concludes at the end.

That's when they really say what they want to say. 

If you want to say, so if you say hey, can you just run that last part by me again?

You're going to get all of it and more. If you're having a hard time, a key word like "budget" and that feeling. 

Listening word for word might not matter, so instead, find words and emotions that are easier to understand. Together, that helps you comprehend.
