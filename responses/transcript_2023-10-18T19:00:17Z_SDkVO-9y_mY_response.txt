Title: How to Sound More Assertive

If you want to sound more assertive, avoid these three phrases. Number one, "I hate to bother you, but you just labeled your behavior now before you even say a word. The other person is thinking this is going to bother me, but when you're assertive, you don't bother anybody. You get their attention, so instead, try this. Just say, when you get a few moments, I'd like to grab your attention."

Two, when you end a sentence with "does that make sense?" you doubt your ability to send a message or doubt the other person's ability to receive it. You carry them along with you and say something like, "Do you have any questions?"

And finally, don't want to or, I don't like to. It signals that you have a standard by which you hold yourself and what they're asking you to do is deviate from that. That's how you sound more assertive. So, try that and follow my lead.
