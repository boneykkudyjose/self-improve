Title: How to Argue with Someone Who Deflects

Deflection is a defense mechanism that we've used ever since we were kids. Anytime we feel a negative message coming our way, we look to reassign it elsewhere. We do this for all kinds of reasons most of the time without even realizing.

When someone deflects and repeats what you said, handle it by making your point clear. If they deflect again, simply repeat your point. If they continue, slow down and stay on your line without going off track. 

In situations where they try to take you off course, stay on point and don't give in. This is crucial during cross-examination; we call this objection nonresponsive. You need to make it clear that they are not addressing the issue at hand.

Sometimes you may need to take a break and think. If someone keeps deflecting, stay firm and repeat your point without getting sidetracked. By following these tips, you can handle situations where someone tries to avoid the topic and stay focused on the conversation.
