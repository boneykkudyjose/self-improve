Title: Accepting Compliments with Grace

In the video, the speaker discussed the right way to accept a compliment. Instead of downplaying the compliment, he suggested embracing it with gratitude.

Number one, rather than deflecting or dismissing the compliment, say thank you and express how it made you feel. For example, let's say somebody's complimenting your shirt.

Instead of saying, "Oh, this old thing," mention where you got it from. For instance, "I got it from J Crew on the sales rack."

Express gratitude by acknowledging the value of the compliment and what it means to you. For example, don't be overly self-critical. Acknowledge the compliment graciously.

When somebody complements you like appreciating your work performance, instead of denying your achievement, acknowledge their observation. For instance, instead of saying, "I was just doing my job," say thank you for recognizing my effort. 

Always remember that accepting compliments doesn't mean absolute agreement. You can express gratitude and politely disagree. For instance, if someone compliments your cooking, don't feel pressured to agree if you don't think it was your best dish.

When someone appreciates your efforts, acknowledge their sentiments and express your gratitude. Remember, a simple "Thank you" goes a long way in fostering positive interactions.

Overall, the video emphasized the importance of gracefully accepting compliments and responding with gratitude and humility. It's all about acknowledging the positive feedback and valuing the kind words shared with you.
