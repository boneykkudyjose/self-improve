**Dealing with Interruptions: Tips from an Attorney**

As an attorney, I deal with conflict daily. So, being interrupted is something I encounter frequently. 

When someone interrupts me, my first step is to allow them to have their say. Just like a fish taking a bait, I let them go. 

If they interrupt me again, I stop and raise my hand, signaling that they need to allow me to finish my point. 

It's essential to respect each other in a conversation. If someone continuously interrupts me, I calmly let them know that I cannot hear them when they keep cutting me off. 

Being patient and assertive is key in handling interruptions effectively. Stand your ground and communicate your need to express yourself fully before being interrupted again.
