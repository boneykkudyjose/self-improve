Title: The Secret to Watching Your Tone

Here is the secret to watching your tone: your tone in an argument is a very accurate predictor of your success in that argument!

If you use a positive tone, you're most likely going to get a positive outcome. Conversely, if you use a negative tone, you're most likely going to get a negative outcome.

This is why an argument may take one or two, even three rounds before reaching a resolution. Anywhere because somebody took a negative tone and let out a big sigh.

They rolled their eyes and I can almost guarantee you the argument started going south as soon as that happened. So, if you want the argument to end peacefully, you need to speak peacefully. Try that and follow me for more tips.
