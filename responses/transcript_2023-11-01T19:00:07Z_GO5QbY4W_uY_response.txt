**Small Talk Formula for Engaging Conversations**

Here's a small talk formula that'll work every time: number one, pick a topic. It can be about the weather; it could be about their clothes. Really, it could be about anything! Ideally, you want it to be interesting, but it doesn't have to be.

Number two, follow it up with a question of preference. For example, let's assume you said, "Hey, beautiful weather we're having today," and they said, "Yeah, it really is." You'd follow it up with something like, "So, are you a summer person, or a fall person?"

Number three, relate to them. It doesn't matter what option they chose. Let's assume in the weather question, they said, "I really like fall." You could say, "I'm with you; I'm Team Fall all the way. I love the weather; it makes me think of my family and how we have football. What about you?"

In these 10-15 seconds, instead of dropping the conversation like you could have done, you've now made a complete connection with that person. So try that and follow me.
