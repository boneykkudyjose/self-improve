Title: How to Handle Insults When Somebody Insults You

In dealing with insults, it's important to understand that when somebody insults you, they're looking for that hit of dopamine from your negative reaction. But, we're not going to give them that satisfaction because, number one, we're going to add distance between what they said and how you respond.

By doing this, you have two options: you can either stare them down, which brings about an awkward silence, making them rethink their words. Or, you can choose to continue to do exactly what you're doing.

Another approach is to simply ask for their name and then to have them repeat the insult. By repeating their insult, the effect of it is diminished.

For instance, when someone insults you and you don't know them well, ask them to give you their name and to repeat what they said. This will disarm the insult and prevent it from having an impact.

In a similar vein, if someone insults you and you know them, rather than getting defensive, try to understand their perspective. By doing this, you can diffuse the situation and take away the power of their insult.

Overall, the key is to choose how you react to insults. Whether you choose to confront the insult head-on or to brush it off, remember that your reaction can significantly impact the outcome.
