Title: How to End a Conversation

In a conversation, number one, when they won't stop talking, make it sound as if you're holding them up. For example, you can say, "All right, I'm going to let you get back to it, or I'm going to let you go. You're making it sound as if they are just as busy as you are."

Respect their time. Number two, close the loop. That means whatever you started talking about, make sure to end it. If you were talking about family, for example, ensure the conversation comes full circle.

Lastly, number three, if you were the one who initiated the conversation, instead of waiting for that awkward space to leave the conversation, just act as if you're checking things off a list. For example, you could say, "Well, I just wanted to come by and say hi, or I just want to come by and see how you're doing."

Remember, time is precious. It's essential to know how to gracefully conclude conversations and respect the mutual exchange.
