Title: How to Reconnect After an Argument

One key aspect is to acknowledge your role in the argument. Don't get into the business of saying who should apologize first or whose offense was more hurtful. Instead, acknowledge what you did, said, and how you behaved. Then, follow up with how you could have handled the situation differently. 

If communication had a breakdown, suggest a redo and offer a solution. For example, propose a different approach that avoids an argument in the first place. This shows willingness to work towards a resolution without coming across as rude.

Ultimately, acknowledging your part in the conflict and offering a new way to address the issue can pave the way for a more constructive interaction.
