Title: How to Cross-Examine a Narcissist!

In a video excerpt from an attorney, here's how to cross-examine a narcissist effectively. Cross-examine a narcissist number one. Call their bluff every time if you don't want to be manipulated. 

"They're going to use that as an anchor. Point to try and later bluff you again."

One thing that helps me when somebody is trying to bluff me is to calmly say, "If you think that's a good look or okay, the only way for them to defend against those statements is to back off. One of the best strategies is to point out every contradiction you hear."

Another method is to keep track of what they say. By maintaining awareness of their statements, you can counter any attempts at manipulation effectively.

If they try to play games, the only real way to handle that is to keep a close eye on the facts. By doing so, you don't give them room to deviate from the truth or divert the conversation.

The key is to slow down your words and speak deliberately. Use a single word effectively to emphasize your points and to avoid distractions during your interaction. Remember, If they go off-topic, stay focused. Remain resolute in your position and don't allow yourself to be swayed.

In conclusion, by being assertive and focused during interactions with narcissists, you can effectively navigate their attempts at manipulation and protect yourself from being drawn into their games.
