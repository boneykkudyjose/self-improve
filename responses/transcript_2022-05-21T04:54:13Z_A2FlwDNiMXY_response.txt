Title: How to Argue Like a Lawyer

In this video, we'll discuss the art of arguing like a lawyer. 

Rule number one: keep it short. The longer you make your point, the less impact it might have. 

When you ask a question, provide the longer version with all details. The answer you receive will often be concise and to the point. 

If you send a long text to your significant other, be prepared for a detailed response. 

Sometimes, not receiving an answer to your question is because it was too lengthy. 

Avoid emotional outbursts in your arguments as they can weaken your position. Keep emotions out of the equation. 

Make your points crystal clear, as a cluttered argument can dilute your message. 

Always aim to communicate effectively and concisely. Don't overwhelm your audience with unnecessary information. 

Remember, when arguing, the logic of your points should take center stage. 

Adding excess emotion can dilute the strength of your argument. Keep it professional and focused. 

Lastly, avoid unnecessary profanity in your arguments as it can be a distraction. Stay clear, concise and articulate in your approach.
