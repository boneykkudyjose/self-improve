Title: Assert Your Boundaries: A Conversation on Taking Control

In this discussion, we explore how to assert your boundaries in an argument at any point in time. You are in complete control of your boundaries, and if you don't protect them, you give the other person permission to drag the conversation wherever they want to take it. Therefore, assert your boundaries early and often. This is what I do - I tell them why I'm there, to discuss one thing. And that's about what happened between us last Friday, and if you want to keep bringing up X, Y, and Z, I'm not going there. So, if I need to give up on this conversation, you need to tell me now. 

Try that and follow along with me.
