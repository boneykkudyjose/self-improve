Title: How to Remove Drama from Your Next Conflict

In this video, we will discuss how to remove drama from your next conflict and how to handle attention-seeking behavior effectively. 

Conflict the next time you think drama, think attention seeking because that's all it is. They bring in drama to call attention.

Think of it this way - all they want is the attention on themselves, so this is what I do when I have to deal with somebody who's dramatic in a conflict. 

They just want the attention on themselves.

Think of a third party when they really just want the attention themselves. 

When they just want the attention on themselves, this is what I do when I want to encourage them.

I'll say things like, "Man, I think you're so resilient that this isn't even going to bother you."

They are so strong, that they don't even let this touch them.

To keep drama away, I focus on speaking positive words to them.

I encourage them by speaking about the attributes I want them to possess in that moment.

That's the moment when you encourage them that drama just washes away. So, try that and follow my lead.
