Title: How to Navigate Difficult Conversations: Cutting Ties with Ease

When you need to say, "I need to cut ties" with someone, you could just stop talking to them altogether. But that's really fading them out if you're in a relationship or friendship and you need to just cut it. That's the way to do it.

Number one, brace them for it. Say, "This is going to be a difficult conversation or might come as a shock to you."

It's not going to be fun to talk about. You're giving them a second to prepare - to let their emotions end without justification.

Start your sentence with, "I need, for example, to close this relationship. I need to step away from this."

In a friendship, you're making it clear that it's not because of what they've done, but because you need to end it without any further contact. Whatever it is, do not use that opportunity to list everything they've ever done wrong to you - just be direct.

Cut it. So, try that and follow me.
