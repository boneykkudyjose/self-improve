Title: Tips for Sounding More Assertive in Conversations

If you want to sound more assertive avoid these three phrases. Number one, "I hate to bother you but you just labeled your behavior now before you even say a word." The other person is thinking this is going to bother me but when you're being assertive you don't bother anybody. You get their attention so instead try this. Just say when you get a few moments.

"I'd like to grab your attention number two when you end a sentence with does that make sense, don't doubt your ability." To send a message or doubt the other person's ability to receive it just carries them along with you and say something like, "Do you have any questions?"

Do you have any thoughts for number three? I don't want to. Or, I don't like to do it sounds much more assertive when you state it in terms of a preference. For example, "I prefer that you didn't" what it signals is that you have a standard by which you hold yourself and what they're asking you to do is deviate from that.

And that's how you sound more assertive. So try that and follow me.
