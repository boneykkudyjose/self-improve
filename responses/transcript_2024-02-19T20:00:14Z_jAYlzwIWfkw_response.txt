Title: Effective Communication: How to Avoid Misunderstandings

Effective communication is the number one way to not be defensive.

Don't interrupt, don't do it because once you interrupt what you are telling the other person is what you have to say is far more important than what they have to say.

Interrupting other person is disrespectful, so let them finish and then address the point.

By letting others express themselves fully, you can better understand their thoughts and intentions.

Asking questions and listening attentively is key to showing respect and creating successful communication.

Therefore, it is crucial to let the other person speak without interruption and give them your full attention.

Only once they have fully expressed themselves can you address the points raised and ensure a meaningful conversation.
