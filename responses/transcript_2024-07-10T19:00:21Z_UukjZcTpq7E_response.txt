Title: Three Rules for Arguing with a Narcissist

When engaging in an argument with a narcissist, there are three important rules to keep in mind. First and foremost, the narcissist believes they are the most powerful individual in the conversation. Therefore, rule number one is to avoid making any moves that could potentially escalate the situation.

The second rule is to refrain from saying anything hurtful. A narcissist often hopes that their behavior will provoke you into saying something unpleasant. By remaining composed and avoiding negative comments, you can avoid falling into this trap.

The final rule is to prioritize your well-being and peace of mind. Walking away from a toxic interaction may be the healthiest response, as trying to correct a narcissist's perspective can be a futile effort that only leads to further frustration.

In conclusion, remember that a narcissist's actions are driven by their own desires and insecurities. By prioritizing self-care and setting boundaries, you can protect your mental and emotional well-being in interactions with a narcissistic individual.
