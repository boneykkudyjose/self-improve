**How to Stop People Pleasing - Number One**

If you're going to please people at least make sure that you're one of them!

If you're so used to making sure everybody else is happy but yourself, we've got to change that. 

**Sale Number Two**

Stop that. You've got to lower your tolerance for accommodating. That means if your gut says no, we don't say yes!

Understand that your time has value and that value is associated with your brand. Your brand—it never goes unnoticed.

**Sale Number Two**

Find your voice, it doesn't need to sound like anybody else. But you know you have it when it speaks the truth without regrets.

**Self-Expression**

Whether you're soft-spoken or loud, own your voice. It doesn't need to be strong to make a statement.

**Practice Makes Perfect**

Practice saying no without any excuses.

Start small with friends at home or a restaurant—it's the only way to grow and assert yourself.

If you live authentically, they'll accept it. They'll adjust, so try it out.

**Follow Through**

That's it, follow me.
