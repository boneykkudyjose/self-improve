Title: How to Respond to "You Should Smile More"

The conversation started with a question: "How to respond to 'you should smile more'?" The advice given was to "smile more."

Another suggestion followed: "Number one, you should say less." It was emphasized by stating, "What you're saying is I have complete say."

Moving on, the discussion shifted to appearance. "Over what my face looks like and how it should respond," was part of the conversation.

A response strategy was proposed: "Should respond so if you stay in your lane." The idea continued, "I'll stay in mine. Number two, no, no."

Next, addressing incomplete sentences: "No is a complete sentence and number three would it help you."

The topic of questioning intentions was then introduced. "When you ask that question, it calls them out like a mirror, and says please."

Understanding the asking party's comfort was set aside, stating, "The reason you're asking is not for my comfort but for your own."

Encouragement was offered at the end: "And make them think twice about asking you again so try that or follow me."
