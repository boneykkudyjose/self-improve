Title: How to Argue Like a Lawyer - Part Four

In this segment, we will explore the key strategies to argue effectively like a lawyer!

Number one: Resist the urge to get defensive. It's very hard to do because it's a natural impulse that we have. But as soon as you get defensive, you are telling the other person that they are on the right track because it makes you look more guilty. So, the harder you push, the more offensive you get.

When you get defensive, you're already losing. Don't throw any personal jabs in there. Otherwise, you've lost because now you're telling the other person that your argument is so weak you have to resort to low-hanging personal jabs to get your point across. It's a no-go, and number two!

Three: Acknowledge what they said. It does not matter whether you agree with it or not. By acknowledging their words, you make them feel heard. Otherwise, you're never going to get them to your side of the court. They're not going to listen to you; they're only going to care about what's happening on their side. Follow me.
