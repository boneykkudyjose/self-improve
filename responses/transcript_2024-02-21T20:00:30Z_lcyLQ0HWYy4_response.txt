Title: **The Importance of Assertiveness in Communication**

You don't want to be aggressive when it comes to communication. Assertive communication is key!

Being assertive means there's a big difference. I'm going to tell you why being aggressive is a display of dominance to try and maintain control over a situation most of the time.

Trying to bully somebody or threaten them is not respectful behavior.

You and I'm going to do whatever it takes to get what I want whereas being assertive says I don't need to reach for anything because I'm already in control.

I don't need to show dominance. I'm confident in who I am and my own emotions.

You respect me, I respect you, but I'm going to be very clear with you where my boundaries lie. For example, aggression is non-negotiable for me.

Assertiveness says give up on the idea of you being in this with me. You need to tell me now, follow me.
