Title: Three Important Questions to Ask Before Giving Advice

Three things to ask before you give advice. Advice number one is, "Is it my business if their name isn't your name, chances are it ain't your business." Their name not being yours means it's likely not your concern.

It ain't your business. Number two: is about help or control. Just because they're doing things differently than you would do doesn't mean it's wrong. Just because it's your advice doesn't mean it's right.

Three: Did they ask because if you give advice without them requesting it, that's called unsolicited. And that kind of advice sounds a lot like criticism. Before you start giving advice, just ask if they want it. And follow me.
