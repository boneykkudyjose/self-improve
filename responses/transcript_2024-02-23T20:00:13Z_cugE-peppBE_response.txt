Title: How to Know if You Make a Good Lawyer

To start off, one of the key indicators that you're a really good lawyer is by being excellent at controlling your own emotions. This means that you're able to step outside of yourself in real-time and label, identify, and manage your own emotions effectively.

Another important aspect is the ability to identify the emotions and feelings of others. This skill, often overlooked, is crucial for long-term success in the legal field.

If you enjoy strategy and thinking ahead, you might find that you excel in making small moves that may not come to fruition until weeks, months, or even years later. This foresight and patience are valuable traits in the legal profession.

Moreover, being adept at thinking on your feet is essential, just like in fast-paced TV shows such as "The West Wing" or "Gilmore Girls". These shows exemplify the need to act quickly and decisively, showcasing skills that are valuable in the legal world.

In conclusion, developing the crucial skill of thinking on your feet and considering the long-term implications of your actions are key attributes that can set you apart as a successful lawyer.
