Title: Tricks to Improve Communication Skills

Paragraph 1:
Here's some tricks I use to never struggle with small talk. Number one, I stay away from static questions like "how's home?" or "how's work?" Those are boring topics.

Paragraph 2:
I just sit there instead. I make my questions action-oriented. Those are much more interesting. Questions about doing, like "what did you do?" 

Paragraph 3:
Y'all, do this weekend? What's been keeping you busy? Action questions make it much more interesting. 

Paragraph 4:
I ask questions that matter. Notice that.

Paragraph 5:
I ask, "What's been keeping you busy?" If I had just said, "You've been staying busy," that's a closed-ended question.

Paragraph 6:
That's just a yes or a no answer. Instead, open it up by asking what has been keeping you busy.

Paragraph 7:
Keeping you busy? Here's another one. Do you have any weekend plans? That's a closed question.

Paragraph 8:
Ended, yes or no. Where are you going this weekend?

Paragraph 9:
Weekend plans that's much more open. 

Paragraph 10:
Interesting. Number three if you've run out of things to say, then you've run out of interest in the conversation.

Paragraph 11:
Rather than forcing it, and the other person noticing that, just politely end it. So try that.

Paragraph 12:
That and follow me.
