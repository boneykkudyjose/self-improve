Title: How to Get Out of a Conversation When You Need To

When you need to get out of a conversation and the other person just keeps on talking, number one: tell them you need to interrupt them, for example, "I need to..."

Interrupt them or I hate to interrupt by acknowledging that's what you're doing.

They won't get offended. Number two: change location, tell them you need to go to another room, maybe it's the bathroom.

Maybe you need to go talk to someone. Whatever it is, don't feel like you have to give them a reason for wanting to get out of the conversation.

If the conversation is all the reason you need, thank them and say something like, "Thank you for talking with me" or "Thank you for sharing that with me, it's a..."

Light little bow at the end that tells them the conversation is over, which allows you to then leave. So try that and follow me.
