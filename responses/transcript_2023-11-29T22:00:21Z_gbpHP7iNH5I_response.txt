Title: Accepting Compliments Gracefully

Accepting a compliment the right way is to accept a compliment instead of downplaying it.

Instead of saying, "Oh, this whole thing, I..." when complimented, say "Thank you and tell them how it made you feel. For example, let's say somebody's complimenting your shirt.

Instead of saying, "Oh, I got it from the sales rack," say "Thank you, that makes me feel good."

Instead of dismissing or deflecting, acknowledge the compliment and say "It means a lot to me."

If someone compliments your work, instead of saying "I was nothing," say "Anybody could have done it."

Saying "Thank you that I appreciate you noticing" is the right way to acknowledge the value of a compliment.

When someone is complimenting you, for example, let's say for a meal, simply respond with appreciation.

Instead of saying "You don't mean that" or deflecting compliments, acknowledge the kind words graciously.

You should have seen how many times I got it right.

Wrong! Say "Thank you, I appreciate you" and never go wrong.

Just a simple "Thank you" and follow my lead.
