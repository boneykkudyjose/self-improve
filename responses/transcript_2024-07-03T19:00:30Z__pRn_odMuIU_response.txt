In the video, the speaker demonstrates how to assertively communicate the phrase 'it's none of your business' when faced with intrusive inquiries. 

For instance, when asked about personal matters that are not relevant in a conversation, a suitable response could be 'That's none of your business.' 

When the question pertains to financial details or other private information, a direct yet assertive reply could be, 'Why do you need to know?' 

It is important to set boundaries and maintain privacy, especially in situations where disclosing personal information is unnecessary.
