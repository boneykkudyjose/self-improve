**Here's What to Say the Next Time You Cry!**

"In an argument, absolutely nothing. Don't feel embarrassed!"

"You dare for one second feel embarrassed or ashamed that you cry. It's the way our body naturally balances itself."

"The higher the tension, the higher the release. It's normal, it's natural, so don't say 'I'm sorry that I'm crying'."

"Or I get emotional. No, we're going to take that, throw it in the trash. You owe nobody anything if you have to say something then label the tears like 'these are tired tears'."

"These are overwhelmed tears, these are tears that care, and if somebody says anything about it just laugh it off. Yeah, I mean, sometimes my stress comes in liquid form."

"But I'm good. Let's keep going, so try that and follow me."
