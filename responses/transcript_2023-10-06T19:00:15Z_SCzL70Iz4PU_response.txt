Title: How to Handle Bad Apologies - Part Two

In this video, we'll discuss the second part of handling bad apologies. 

Number one: the toxic Apollo.

Apology where they say, "Well, I'm sorry."

That I'm such a horrible person, or I'm sorry that you're so perfect. It's manipulative, they want you to say you're not a terrible person. Well, that's how you make me feel, you always... and now you are comforting them the next time that happens, ignore it, you don't say anything.

That's how you take the power away from them. Instead, you will stay in your ground and say, "I am willing to accept an apology."

Apology number two: justifying.

Apology, this is where it begins with - "I was just kidding. I was just messing around instead of getting upset."

You will calmly respond with, "It sounds like you're confusing an excuse with... an apology."

Apology if I did anything wrong, as if it's still undecided. You will assertively say, "For me, there is no 'if'." 

How you did was wrong, and it deserves an apology.

That's how experts advice you should handle bad apologies.
