Title: Understanding Communication Etiquette in Difficult Conversations

In the video transcript, a scenario is presented where one person starts crying during an argument. The narrator advises on proper communication etiquette in such a situation. 

Firstly, when the other person starts crying, the narrator suggests saying nothing and acting as if it is not happening. This approach allows the emotional individual the space to express themselves without feeling judged.

Next, the narrator mentions the importance of assessing if the person needs a tissue. Implicitly offering assistance without directly asking can show empathy and support.

Furthermore, during heated moments, the narrator recommends remaining calm and normal, possibly even suggesting a break to diffuse the tension.

In case the emotional person needs to express themselves, it is vital to listen attentively without interrupting. Nodding can signify understanding and encourage the other person to continue sharing.

In conclusion, the narrator emphasizes the significance of being patient and actively listening during difficult conversations. By following these communication etiquette guidelines, it is possible to navigate challenging interactions with empathy and understanding.
