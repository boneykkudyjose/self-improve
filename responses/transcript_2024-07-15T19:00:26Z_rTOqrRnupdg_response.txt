Title: How to Handle Rejection in the Workplace

In response to being told, "That's not my job number one," you can straightforwardly reply, "I'm not the person you want."

"I'm not the person you want, what you're saying is I'm not a great fit for this."

"It works because it's direct and also considers what's best or what's most beneficial for the other person if it's not something you want to do."

"If it's not your job, then you're not the person they want. They need to find someone else."

"Number two, if it's a person you have a close relationship with, you can use, 'I'm here for my part, not yours.'"

"My part is not yours. What you're saying is outside my scope."

"In a softer approach, you can ask the question, 'Here for my part, not yours.'"

"My part is not yours, what you're saying is."

"I'm here for a particular reason and what you're asking me to do is outside."

"In my scope, number three, if you want a softer approach, you can ask the question."

"What solution do you have so far, what checks?"

"What solution do you have so far, it checks them to make sure they've actually thought of a solution rather than just coming to you."

"And that's how to say, 'That's not my job.'"

"So, you try that, we follow me."
