Title: How to Maintain Control in an Argument

When in an argument, you want to maintain control. Here's how to do it! This is one of my favorites because it works every time if you want to maintain control in an argument.

If you want to maintain control in an argument, do not raise your voice as soon as you raise your voice, you're telling the other side that the words of your argument aren't strong enough.

As soon as you raise your voice, you're telling the other side that the words of your argument aren't strong enough.

So, here's what you should do: instead of raising your voice, repeat back to them what you said slowly and firmly. For example, let's say you're raising your voice and you say, "I already told you I am not going to do that."

Instead, cut out the threat to gain control when you're losing control. Instead, cut out the already-told-you part and repeat back to them slowly, "I am not going to do that."

Try that and follow me.
