Title: Increasing Emotional Intelligence through Conversational Values

In this video, we will discuss how to increase your emotional intelligence through conversational values. These are promises that you make to yourself and every communication that you have. They act to make decisions for you and set an example. Let me share with you one of mine.

Number one - where there is room for kindness, I will use it regardless of what others may say about me. My value lies in the kindness I show.

Number two - I will tell them who I am without needing to explain it to them. My actions will speak louder than my words ever could.

Number three - if I can't bridge the gap, I will be a lighthouse - a beacon that sometimes stands alone. Even if the other person doesn't want to connect, they can still see where I stand. 

If they ever change their mind and seek to come back, I won't be hard to find. These are my communication values, and hopefully, they encourage you to discover and follow your own path. Let me guide you through it.
