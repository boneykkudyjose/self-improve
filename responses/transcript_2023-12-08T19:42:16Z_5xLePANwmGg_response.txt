**Title: What to Say When You Need to Apologize**

One fundamental rule is to begin your sentence with "I'm sorry" when you need to apologize. Then, add on an action verb, for example, "I'm sorry that I snapped at you."

It's also essential to be more specific. For instance, say, "I'm sorry for what I said that embarrassed you. It's not enough to just say sorry."

Next time, insert your remedy, follow it up with a specific action. For example, "I apologize, next time I will ask you before making a decision."

End your apology with a period, not a comma. It shows sincerity, like saying, "I'm sorry that I snapped at you."

Lastly, never use the word "but" in an apology. Instead of saying, "I'm sorry, but," simply take responsibility for your actions. For instance, "I'm sorry, I will try to do better."

Remember, an apology is not an excuse. So, when apologizing, avoid using the word "excuse." Instead, genuinely acknowledge your mistake and make amends.
