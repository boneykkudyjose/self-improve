Number one, if it feels like you're talking to a brick wall, it's because you are.

There are people who always have to be right. They have tied their identity into the idea of being right, which means while you're just questioning, "Hey, what's the right solution here?" they hear you question their identity and that's a wall we can't change but we can manage it.
