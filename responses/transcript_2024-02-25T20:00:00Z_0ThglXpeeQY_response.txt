**How to Change Topics in a Conversation**

So, there's going to be that point in the conversation where things start to go a little stale or awkward, or the energy starts to die. You need to change topics. Well, you know that the best way to change topics is to ask a question.

But it's the transition that matters and this transition that I use and encourage you to use is a reminder. As if you just got reminded of a topic that you want them to contribute to and people like it because it sounds like you've been thinking about them and you're interested in them.

It's going to make them want to talk about it. For example, you could say something as simple as, "Oh hey, that reminds me and then ask a question or hey, I meant to ask you the other day and ask a question."

People love that kind of stuff and that transition makes them feel really valued. So, use that anytime you need to change topics. Follow me.
