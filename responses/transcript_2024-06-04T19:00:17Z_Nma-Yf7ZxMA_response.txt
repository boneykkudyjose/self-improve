Title: How to Respond When Someone Invalidates Your Feelings

When faced with someone invalidating your feelings, it is essential to assert yourself. Calmly state, "I feel how I feel, so if they're telling you you're too sensitive or overreacting, express, "I feel how I feel."

Express assertively that you have the right to experience all your emotions without justification. By using firm but respectful phrases like, "I acknowledge that what you’re saying is there's no part of this that's up for debate, I'm fully within my rights to experience all of my emotions without justification or explanation,” you establish and enforce healthy boundaries.

Furthermore, communicate that you get to decide the significance of your feelings. For instance, if someone tells you there is no reason to be upset, respond with, "I get to decide that this is a big deal."

Remember that your feelings are valid and real. Your emotional well-being matters, and it's critical to advocate for yourself. If someone dismisses your feelings, remind them that your emotions are valid. If they try to push you aside, assert your need to be acknowledged.

In instances where no response is given or required, understand that silence can sometimes be the best response. Take control of the situation by not engaging in unnecessary or toxic conversations. Trust in the validity of your emotions and prioritize your well-being.

Overall, always prioritize your emotional well-being and remember that your feelings are valid and deserving of respect.
