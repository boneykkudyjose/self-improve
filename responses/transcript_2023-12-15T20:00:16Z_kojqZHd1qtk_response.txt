Title: How to Be More Assertive

In this video, we will discuss how to improve assertiveness and communicate effectively in various situations. 

One key aspect of being more assertive is to vocalize your intentions clearly. For example, stating your next steps and following through demonstrates confidence and clarity in communication. 

Furthermore, expressing your boundaries can empower you in interactions. By vocalizing what you will and will not tolerate, you establish a sense of control over your interactions.

Another tip for assertiveness is to use phrases that convey authority and confidence. By using language that asserts your position, you can influence how others interact with you and show that you are not willing to be treated in a way that compromises your values.

Overall, it's essential to practice assertiveness in your daily interactions to build confidence and create a more respectful and empowering environment for yourself.
