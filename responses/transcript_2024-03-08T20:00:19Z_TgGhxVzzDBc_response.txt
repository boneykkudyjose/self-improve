Title: Communicating Assertively When Being Interrupted

In the video, the speaker discusses how to respond when someone interrupts you during a conversation. 

One effective tip is to politely assert yourself by using phrases like "Number one, instead of saying excuse me, I was still talking," to calm and assertively communicate your point.

When facing an interruption, you can calmly state, "I can't hear you when you interrupt me," which helps set boundaries and maintain focus in the conversation.

Another suggestion is to address interruptions by saying, "If you want me to listen to what you're saying, please wait." This approach emphasizes the importance of mutual respect in communication.

In situations where interruptions persist, showing control through body language and vocal tone can help convey the message that you expect to be heard until you finish speaking.

Handling interruptions gracefully by acknowledging the need to wait your turn and avoiding talking over others demonstrates maturity and good communication skills.

Finally, it is essential to set clear boundaries in conversations, such as signaling intentions to speak next with a raised hand and calmly stating, " You're next," to manage interruptions effectively.

By practicing these strategies, you can navigate interruptions confidently and ensure that your voice is heard in conversations.
