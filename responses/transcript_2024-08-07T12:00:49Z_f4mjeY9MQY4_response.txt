**Title: "Effective Communication Strategies"**

Here's some tricks I use to never struggle with Small Talk. Number one, stay away from static questions like "how's home, how's work, those are boring."

Topics I just sit there instead, I make my questions action-oriented. Those are the questions that matter, notice that.

I ask, "what has been keeping you busy? Action questions make it much more interesting." 

Another one, "Do you have any weekend plans that's close?" 

Yes or no, where are you going this weekend? That's a much more open-ended question. 

If you've run out of things to say, then you've run out of interest in the conversation rather than forcing it and the other person.

**Closing comment:**
"Noticing, just politely end it. So try that and follow me."
