Title: Tips on Being Taken More Seriously

"How to be taken more seriously, number one: stop underselling your value when you say things like forgive me for the dumb question, or I'm probably overthinking this. Something you think makes you sound humble, it doesn't; it makes you sound like you're trying to lower their expectation. Lowering the standard by which they hold your word, and if you don't take your value seriously, well, neither will they. Number two: cutting back on the cussing makes you sound stronger and more serious; it doesn't make you sound like you're trying to be less believable. It's like over-seasoning your food; it makes your words hard to swallow."

"Number three: Stand by your boundaries. Now, you think it makes you sound like you're being difficult; it doesn't. It makes you sound like you don't mind disappointing. People that you know, if you want others to respect you, you first have to respect yourself, and that's how to be taken more seriously. So try that, and follow me."
