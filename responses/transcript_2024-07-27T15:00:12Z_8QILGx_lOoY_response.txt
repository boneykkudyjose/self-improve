Title: Tips for Being More Assertive in Communication

When you need to sound more assertive, here's what I want you to do: number one!

Stop over apologizing. This is where you say, "I'm sorry, so sorry, in every single sentence. I know it's a tick, I know it's hard.

Say what you mean in every sentence. I know it's a habit, but you got to stop. 

Going to explain why number two is important: stop undervaluing what you have to say. That's crucial.

When you downgrade your comment before you even get it out again, this is hurting your confidence. We're going to dive into it, and that's where number three comes in.

Get comfortable with the word "no." Get comfortable disappointing people. No is a complete sentence.
