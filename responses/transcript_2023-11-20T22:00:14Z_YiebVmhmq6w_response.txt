Title: Creating a Safe Space for Conversation

In this video, three responses will create a safe space for conversation no matter what upsetting or difficult news is brought to you. Somebody brings you news, and you can still create a safe space for open communication when you number one begin your response with "I'm glad you came to me with this." You acknowledge that you have a choice in who you share your information with, and you felt comfortable and trusted enough to value that number. 

If someone else is sharing their point of view, appreciate their effort because no matter what side of an issue they are on, we can always appreciate their perspective. Sometimes it's not easy to open up and simply share things, so thank you.

Number three, start your response with "I appreciate your perspective because no matter what." Diagnosing is vital to understand someone if you want to reach them first. You acknowledge the person's effort in sharing their point of view, showing that they are necessary. You then appreciate the perspective that the person shared.

In conclusion, create a safe space in the conversation, so try that and follow me.
